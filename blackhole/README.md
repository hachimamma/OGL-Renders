# Blackhole Renderer

Blackhole renderer to draw a 'falling into a blackhole' experience.

Spiralling into a blackhole starting a bit away from the Event Horizon to get a good look at the accretion disk, the event horizon and the POV from both sides.

The singularity rendering is a bit complex. I made it as mathematical and scientific as possible. Please do let me know if it can be better.
