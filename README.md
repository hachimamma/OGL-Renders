# OpenGL Renders

This is an repository on which I am rendering random stuff which I think would look cool. Stuff like blackhole, gamma functions and others things, I will be using OpenGL only and the native in C++

I am open to ideas, corrections and recommendations!

# To Run (For beginners)

$ `bash build.sh`

and it'll do it for you!

# Otherwise you know the method,

$ `chmod +x build.sh`

If you enjoy using these simulations, please consider starring!
